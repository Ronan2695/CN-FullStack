<!-- CSS POSITION PROPERTY

Static is the default position all your HTML elements will have, when they enter on to the page
Static will just follow the elements in the document flow.
Relative Positioning.
    Acts exactly like static posotioning, but it allows you to do four specific things.
    You can change the top,left,right and bottom of this element.
    Relative would allow you to change the position of the element relative to it normally would be.
    The element would be removed from the document flow.
    All top,left,right and bottom would do is remove the element out of the document flow.

Absolute Positioning.
Absolute completly removes the element from the document flow.
Absolute is used when you want stick something at a specific position and don't want anything to move around it.
Absolute allows you to do top,left,right and bottom.
You can position it according to relative, top left right and bottom.
Relative and absolute can play together. Any element which is relativly positioned can have absolutely positioned elements inside of it.

FIXED POSITIONING
They stay in the same place when you scroll.
It positions itself based on the Entire HTML page.

STICKY
Sticky is combination of both relative and fixed position in to one.
